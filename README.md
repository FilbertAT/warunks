# warunks
Warunks is an innovative application concept designed to connect traditional Indonesian shops, known as "warungs," with nearby homes. Our vision is to enhance the accessibility and convenience of local shopping by bridging the gap between warungs and their potential customers across Indonesia. This platform aims to support local businesses by making their goods and services easily accessible to a broader audience. As the idea develops, we plan to integrate features that cater to both the warungs and the customers' needs, creating a seamless shopping experience.

Current Stage: Conceptualization

Stay tuned for updates as we flesh out the details and begin turning "Warunks" into a reality!
